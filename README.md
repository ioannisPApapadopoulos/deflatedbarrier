### Synopsis ###

DeflAted Barrier method (DAB)

The deflated-barrier library implements the deflated barrier method of Papadopoulos, Farrell and Surowiec. The objective is to compute multiple minima of topology optimization problems which are non-convex, PDE & inequality-constrained optimization problems.

### Dependencies ###


The code is written in Python using FEniCS: a finite element solver platform. Instructions for set up can be found at http://fenicsproject.org/download. (version >=  2017.1.0, compiled with PETSc, petsc4py and HDF5 support).


The deflated-barrier library also depends on

petsc4py (https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py)

h5py (http://www.h5py.org/)

matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org, for rendering iteration tables)

slepc4py (https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py, for computing stabilities)

### Code examples ###

The easiest way to learn how to use the deflated-barrier package is to examine the examples in examples/. Start with examples/double-pipe.

Iteration tables for double-pipe, roller-pump and neumann-outlet double-pipe example can be generated by the command

	make iterationtables

The cantilever and mbb-beam examples together with continuation and grid-sequencing can be generated by the command

	make compliance


### Installation ###

Install package with the following command in the initial directory

	pip3 install .
